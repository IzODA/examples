    "# Credit Risk Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "A credit risk is the risk of default on a debt that may arise from a borrower failing to make required payments. Someone who defaults on their loans can mean a lot of money lost for a financial institution and at the same time, false negatives (i.e. declining a loan when they are capable of repaying the money) can mean money lost from interest. In the following, we perform some exploratory analysis using the German Credit Data stored in the UCI Machine Learning Repository [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data)"

Refer to the [IBM Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/) for product documentation (search: \"Open Data Analytics\"). After the connection is established, we will use this connection to retrieve the data and store it in a dataframe using the python library, [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)."
